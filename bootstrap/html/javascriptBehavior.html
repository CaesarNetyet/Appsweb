                  At Parkland, our patients are at the heart of everything we do. That is why the new Parkland hospital was designed with your needs in mind.
                  
                  Today, Parkland remains one of the busiest public hospitals in the nation, with more than 1 million patient visits each year. But demand for Parkland services continues to grow.
                  
                  The new 2.8 million-square-foot Parkland campus is located on the northeast corner of Harry Hines Boulevard and Medical District Drive. At nearly twice the size of the old hospital, the new Parkland has been designed to meet the ever-changing needs of Dallas County – one of the largest, fastest-growing regions in the country.
                  
                  Every aspect of the new Parkland hospital was thoughtfully planned to enhance the patient experience but still preserve safe, quality care. Our leaders traveled across the country to visit other successful hospital building programs. What we learned from those experiences give Parkland’s patients the best medical facilities Dallas County has to offer. See some of these facilities in this video tour from the Irving Community Television Network.

                  Parkland’s strategic plan sets the objectives we hope to achieve through 2026. We have identified challenges to achieving a healthy community and outlined the priorities in this plan to turn those challenges into opportunities - to improve care for patients, to improve access to healthcare and to improve health outcomes across our community.
    
                  
                  This strategic plan serves as our GPS and keep our work focused on creating a Dallas County with equitable, accessible healthcare for all.
                  At the core of the plan is health equity. As the safety net health system for Dallas County we will work to ensure all residents can receive the necessary high-quality care so they can live life fully without the suffering associated with delayed or deferred care.
